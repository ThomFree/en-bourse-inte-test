# EnBourse Integration Test

## How to participate ?

- First, fork this repository as a private repository on your Github account
- Add me (@ThomFree) as a collaborator on the project
- Then, start the test by finishing to read this README.md file

## The test

You will have to integrate in HTML, CSS and JS an almost complete EnBourse page.
Use all your knowledge and skills to go as far as you can in this test.
We would like you to commit your work for each part of the page that you do.

- Look at the PSD file **"EnBourse-test-page.psd"** and integrate this page in the **index.html** file
- You can use JQuery, Bootstrap and Line Awesome Icons to do so
- Don't forget to take care of the "responsivness" of your page

For any buttons on this page, it should do the following:

- OnHover: a different style should be applied
- OnClick: the text of the button should be replaced by ```<i class="las la-spinner"></i>```
- OnClick: the button should be disabled, and the mouse cursor set to ```not-allowed```
- OnClick: A Bootstrap modal is displayed and you can quit it via a button or by clicking outside of the modal window.

Enjoy!

## What will be evaluated ?

To differenciate you from others, this is what we are going to look in your work:

- Your code
- The "responsivness" of your page
- The total time you took to do the test
- Your Git skills
